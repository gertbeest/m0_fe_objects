# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
    -I struggled with syntax for objects, as well as the idea of adding keys that don't look like they're in the inside the original object. Also the terms for objects' parts are hard to keep seaparate in my head.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes? 
    -I switched from a physical pen and paper style note taking system to a computerized one (Logseq) because it's much faster and clearer than my handwriting. It's a geat tool because you can use hashtags to log terms in its little system that you can search for any time, which will bring up anything mentioning that hashtag. I use it to log terms and ideas with code blocks beneath for examples (it uses a MarkDown style thing to do this).

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
    -I Google to see a clear example so I don't get confused first, to learn it the "correct" way, then go for the problem. That way I know what something is supposed to look like properly before I mess it up, haha.
